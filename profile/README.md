Hello friend ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™ve been working in the sysadmin, DevOps and cybersecurity domains. I started with Go around 2018 after using mostly Bash, Perl and Python. It took me quite some time to become productive in Go but now I use it (with a bit of Bash for smaller tasks) most of the time â€” for building tools, automation and platforms.

This organization holds repositories with handcrafted tutorials and tools that I write mainly to keep learning and experimenting.
