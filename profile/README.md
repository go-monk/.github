Hello friend ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™ve been working in the sysadmin, DevOps and cybersecurity domains. I came to Go after using mostly Bash, Perl and Python. It took me a while to become productive in Go but now I use it (with a bit of Bash for smaller tasks) most of the time â€” for building tools, automation and platforms, as well as for learning and experimenting.

This organization holds repositories with handcrafted Go code and writings.
