Hello friend ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™ve been working in the sysadmin, devops and cybersecurity domains. I started with Go around 2018 after using mostly Bash, Perl and Python. It took me quite some time to become productive in Go but now I find it very useful - for building tools, automation and platforms.

This organization holds tutorials and tools that I write mainly to keep learning and experimenting. Here's some feedback about the content:
