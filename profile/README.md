Hello friend ðŸ‘‹. I've been working in the sysadmin, devops and cybersecurity domains. I came to Go from mostly Bash/Perl/Python. It took me quite some time to get productive in Go but now I'm using it (+ some Bash for smaller tasks) most of the time. For building tools, automation and platforms. Also for learning and playing around.
