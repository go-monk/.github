Hello friend ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™ve been working in the sysadmin, DevOps, and cybersecurity domains. I came to Go after using mostly Bash, Perl, and Python. It took me a while to become productive in Go, but now I use it (with a bit of Bash for smaller tasks) most of the time â€” for building tools, automation, and platforms, as well as for learning and experimenting.
