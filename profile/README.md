Hello friend ðŸ‘‹. I've been working in the sysadmin/devops/cybersecurity domains. I came to Go from Bash/Perl/Python. It took me quite some time to get productive in Go but now I'm using Go (+ some Bash for smaller tasks) most of the time. For building tools, automation and platforms. Also for learning and playing around.
